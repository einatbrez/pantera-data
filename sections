 abstract. It’s a good conceptual basis, and usefully
 provides the metaphors and explanations you’ll
 need to communicate this kind of management
 style to other managers. But it won’t give you the
nitty-gritty of how to implement it"

                  It is a (mostly) sympathetic portrait of people
                  who did interesting and often under-appreciated stuff in the early days of the PC and
                  just before and after. It gives a clear picture
                  of their value to the world and their values,
                  which are not always mainstream, and it
                  presents them as lovable if quirky. In the process, it often accepts their worldview uncritically. This is a community I am a part of, at
                  least on the edges, and I like to see it appreciated. I do not think that uncritically accepting it is healthy. There is a fine line between
                  celebrating difficult people and making it
                  seem like you have to be anti-social to do any
                  important work in computing, and I don’t

        "title": "Section 4", 
        "content":"In general, the metaphors people use for thinking about business are based on sports or on war.
                  These have several risks. For instance, sports metaphors translate poorly between cultures or to nonenthusiasts. Often a sports-unenthused audience
                  may have only the vaguest idea what the speaker
                  means. War metaphors often result in people being
                  metaphorically exhorted to kill the customer or
                  die in the attempt, which is not apt to result in a
                  productive relationship.
                  I was therefore happy to find a book that used a
                  metaphor which is inherently based in collaboration and pleasing the audience, rather than attacking it. (And amused to discover that the author
                  likes to translate his insights into sports and war
                  metaphors, just in case you needed something
                  more familiar and macho. The temptation to stray
                  back into social commentary is very high here.)
                  Aside from appreciating the base metaphor, I also
                  like the content a lot. It includes a number of
                  insights that are common (hire good performers,
                  enable them to lead as needed, watch the health of
                  the team) and some that are not. The discussion of
                  feedback loops and “hunting” is particularly rare.
                  Even rarer, it discusses the good and bad points of
                  its advice, instead of merely advocating One True
                  Way."

      {
        "title": "Section 5", 
        "content":"I didn’t read it when it first came out, because it
                  was a book that many people I knew loved and
                  that I was pretty sure I’d hate for fundamentally
                  feminist reasons. I didn’t need to be fighting with
                  my friends over it, but early in my career my
                  feelings about being a woman in computing were
                  pretty raw, for very good reason. And, indeed, even
                  all these decades later, I gritted my teeth through
                  most of the early chapters. It’s not that women are
                  never mentioned. No, that would actually be an improvement. Instead, the possession of a girlfriend
                  or wife is used as a kind of indicator of level of
                  socialization; if you have a woman, you are socially
                  competent. If you don’t, you aren’t. (This is not, in
                  my experience, accurate, in either direction.) And
                  one of the interviewees presents the concept that
                  women are so underrepresented as hackers that
                  there must be a genetic cause, which is exactly
                  as stupid as saying that Macintosh viruses are
                  so rare that there must be a hardware cause. (In
                  case you’re wondering, Macintosh viruses are rare
                  mostly for cultural/economic reasons—PC viruses
                  pay better—and to some extent for software reasons.) Culture and genetics interact in complicated
                  ways, but culture is vastly influential, as important
                  to human behavior as software is to computer
                  behavior."
